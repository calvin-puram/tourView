## PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

The development of this Application took into account several specific needs. It is carefully crafted as one that can easily require updates and new features, taking into account the need for scalability, easy maintainance, performance and security. I have chosen to use the MODEL-VIEW CONTROLLER (MVC)
architecture.
